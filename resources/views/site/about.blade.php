                        is a part of a compendium of interventions by the organisation to address
                        the information gap in the Pan-African industrial sector as a way of catalysing
                        synergies and facilitating a robust conversation about industrialisation processes and trade.
                        This is intended to contribute in a small way be it may, to the efforts of raising industrial GDP
                        in Africa to 130% by 2025 as envisaged or US$ 1.72 trillion and drive Africaâ€™s overall GDP from US$ 2.2
                        trillion to US$ 4.6 trillion through synergistic industrialisation and trade within the continent.</p>

                    <p> The publication highlights the role of various industrial stakeholders in industrialising Africa and
                        also showcases best practices and gold standard case studies on the continent. This information sharing
                        platform provided by the Industrialising Africa magazine is designed to catalyse and maintain the
                        industrialisation conversation on the African continent in this modern era.</p>
